# Precipitating-Kindness

Few weeks ago, Kerala witnessed its worst floods in a century. Water levels rose rapidly, submerging many homes, and buildings. Almost the entire population of the state were directly or indirectly impacted by the floods.

While the state managed the calamity very well, reconstruction activities and bringing the lives of those severely impacted back to normal will take many months and even years.

JEA Digital envisions the use of Blockchain technology to leapfrog the reconstruction process by bringing about transparency, non-repudiation and security to efficiently sanction and track the progress of reconstruction projects.

RebuildingLives Platform will bring together The Government, Beneficiaries of Reconstruction, Technocrats and Professionals who support and validate reconstruction activities, and Contractors who deliver the services into a single platform.

Thousands of homes were destroyed completely in the floods. We take the usecase of rebuilding homes, to demonstrate the use of Blockchain platform that will eliminate bureaucratic hurdles, reduce cycle time and ensure that checks and balances required in large scale projects are implemented with no exceptions.
